# Welcome to Assorion Experimental

Here I will test changes to different parts of the engine.
Some of these changes may or may not make it into the default engine.

If you are a passer by, do **NOT** use this. Use the default Assorion engine linked 
under my Github profile. 

This fork is incredibly unstable and crashes all the time, it also has countless bugs.

## Current changes

1. Different note handling: Playstate.hx
2. Different settings handling: Settings.hx
3. Different key input handling: Musicbeatstate.hx

The changes listed above contain the main file that was edited, which will include 
documentation on the changes.
